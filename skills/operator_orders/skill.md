    execute_tool: get_store_order_queue
  - id: select_order

      Present the open orders from the queue tool result (Order ID, customer, item, size, milk type).
      Ask which order they want to prepare, and record the Order ID in selected_order_id.
    complete_when: session.operator_orders.selected_order_id
  - id: verify_recipe

      Verify drink specifications: cup size, dairy/plant milk selection, and any special preparation instructions.
      Confirm recipe checks with the barista and set recipe_verified to true.

      Call @tool.update_order_pickup_status with selected_order_id and new_status "brewing".
